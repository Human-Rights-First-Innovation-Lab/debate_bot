0,How would you address the issue of public education funding in Washington?,"To address the issue of public education funding in Washington, I believe we need to focus on prioritizing spending rather than just increasing revenue. It's essential to evaluate how funds are allocated within the educational system to ensure they are directed effectively. Additionally, we should strive to meet the legal mandate of allocating 50% of the budget to education, which is currently not being met. Exploring options like charter schools could also provide more choices for parents and help create equity in education across the state. Lastly, consolidating","[""education in this state and a dozen years ago, the state Supreme Court ruled that the state's education finance system was unconstitutional, though the legislature poured billions.

I think, critical issues facing our education system is, you have these inequities across the state.

Issue. And I think we're, we really need to evaluate where the spending within our educational system is being applied. I know that teachers unions may not like to hear this, but we have some of the highest teachers didn't used to be that way, but we do today and I think that we need to take a look at first of all, prioritizing spending.

The one way to instill greater accountability might be to have the superintendent of public schools that they have in it position. Governor gregoir advocated for this, even Chris reichdal, the present superintendent of public education has in the past suggested that this might be a problem, a reasonable way to consolidate all the many different agencies that have a sort of finger in education and to focus accountability under right presently, there's really nobody who can answer for our as you reference, are. Pretty lackluster outcome, so I'm wondering what you think about. The possibility is I totally agree with that. I'm glad you mentioned it. I do think that there's, it needs to be a correct, a moment through the governor and that could be one way that could happen in directing, making sure that we get the 50% funding making sure that we, I have this spokesperson, it takes leadership to run a governor's office and you can't do that if you have to fight with elected officials and boards. Hello, hello. Right. So what is that?""
 '""We\'re supposed to have 50% of the budget directly attributed to education, which it isn\'t. That would be a strong message that a new governor could send — that we\'re going to hit that 50% mandate. It\'s the law, and in my opinion, we should be striving to spend that 50%. But again, you have to look at priorities and where we\'re spending our money. What do we want to build here? We\'re behind Mississippi when it comes to education, and the failure we\'ve had here in Washington state. I think looking at how to consolidate education efforts and hold people accountable is important, and making sure that we spend that 50% on education would send a strong message.""'

1,How would you address the issue of public education funding in Washington?,"I would prioritize increasing the percentage of our budget allocated to K-12 education, as it has decreased in recent years. My experience in budget management, particularly as chair of the King County Council, has taught me the importance of making the right investments in education.

For kids and the challenge is the needs as you are known if I get some these issues, the needs are only increasing when it comes to education. Special education is one example right?

The funding is not competes with school construction. As the Republic Washington books, their one talk about the Capitol needs for their schools.

 '""So the percentage of our budget going to K-12 education has actually gone down in recent years. As governor, I\'ll change that. As a son of a schoolteacher, I know how important that is. And that gets down to prioritization—our budgets reflect our values when it comes to education. Look, one of us has experience in doing that. When I was chair of the King County Council, I chaired the budget committee. I worked in a bipartisan way to adopt a budget that balanced our budget, had bipartisan support from politicians of a whole range of political stripes, and made the right investments for our county. Also, I\'m not afraid of taking on big challenges in doing a budget. I was a King County Council member—the only Democrat who actually supported reducing the size of the King County Council. You know, the politicians—I reduced the politicians from 13 down to 9. It cost me my job—I had to run again in a new district to stay on the King County Council. But I still support that. Why? Because we need to be frugal with your tax dollars, we need to prioritize your tax dollars, and education will be an absolute key for me as governor.""'

2,How would you approach the issue of affordable housing?,"I would approach the issue of affordable housing by streamlining zoning laws and speeding up the permitting process to facilitate new developments. Additionally, I would require or incentivize developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing in their projects. It's crucial to integrate social services alongside housing solutions to support individuals effectively. I would also conduct audits of state-funded homelessness programs to identify and eliminate ineffective spending, ensuring that resources are used efficiently to address the interconnected issues of housing, homelessness, and public safety.","[""Housing Affordability.

Address Rising Food Prices. With the fourth highest food prices in America, we must do more for everyone who is struggling to put food on the table. We start by reducing the cost of transportation, driven by rising fuel prices that inevitably get passed along to the consumer. Productive Government Spending.

 '""What I would do as Governor is reevaluate the programs currently in use. I’d determine which programs help foster kids and formerly incarcerated people and which ones don’t. Some programs are a waste of money, and we need to reassess that. Over the last few years, the state has put over $2.4 billion into homelessness and housing. But 65% of respondents in a recent poll said they still believe housing costs will continue to rise. I think the mistake made early on was assuming the solution was all about housing. There have been failed attempts, like the vacant hotels, where people moved in without any social services or requirements to stay clean and sober. Those buildings were destroyed and are now boarded up.""'

And I. Ask this person. How did that work? And he told me? He said, you know, it was a total, a waste of money back when they first started addressing this issue, it was all about housing, it cannot be about housing. It has to be about housing and it has to be about social services, the surrounding of social services, putting your arm around a person holding their hand caring for them and taking them through the process of recovery step-by-step by step, we didn't get to this point overnight with the crime problem, because you really can't separate the criminal justice, public safety from homelessness or from the economy, they're all interconnected, so yes, I would appoint a director of homelessness.

We need to be innovative and consider all options. While using battleships as temporary housing may not be the best idea, it illustrates the need for creative solutions.

3,How would you approach the issue of affordable housing?,"I would approach the issue of affordable housing by focusing on increasing inventory, with a goal of constructing 200,000 new housing units of various types in my first term.

I put it right in my voter\'s pamphlet statement for my vision for the state—constructing 200,000 units of new housing, housing of all kinds, in my first term as governor. As Attorney General, we recently took on another lawsuit, Dave, standing up for Washingtonians—an entity that\'s engaging in price-fixing on rent, artificially raising rents and making Washingtonians all across our state pay more. That violates the law and harms Washingtonians and goes exactly to what Austin\'s getting at—higher rents. That\'s unacceptable. So look, I\'m open to proposals that address exorbitant hikes. Look, the good news is most landlords don\'t want to do that—they want to play by the rules. But we need to make sure that we have a housing market that works for all Washingtonians. One more thing I\'ll say on housing, which was a key part of your question—look, housing is buried in the bureaucracy of state government. The head of housing is buried in Commerce. I\'m going to pull that person out and that team out, and guess what? The head of housing is going to be a member of my cabinet.
