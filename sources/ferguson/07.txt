“Once again, President Trump is ignoring the law, this time by ‘appointing’ an illegitimate attorney general,” said Ferguson. “This must be challenged.”

The brief, signed by 14 other Attorneys General, supports Maryland’s request to block Whitaker from exercising the authority of the U.S. Attorney General’s office, or to substitute Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in his place. The Attorneys General point out that Whitaker’s appointment is “fraught with constitutional doubts.”

“The legal controversy surrounding Mr. Whitaker’s appointment has threatened the legitimacy of the Department’s actions and the vital relationship between the Department and the States,” the Attorneys General write. “The Amici States therefore have an urgent interest in a lawful resolution of this issue, so that no doubts surround the legitimacy and authority of the Office of the U.S. Attorney General.”
