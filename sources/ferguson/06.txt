“Scott Pruitt’s resignation is long overdue. When looking for the next person to lead the EPA, I encourage the President to select someone who follows the rule of law.

“Since Scott Pruitt took over, my office has led or joined nearly a dozen lawsuits against the EPA. We are undefeated in those lawsuits. Three lawsuits against Pruitt’s EPA resulted in successful outcomes that cannot be appealed.

“Regardless of his or her political ideology, the EPA must have an ethical, law-abiding leader in order to fulfill its critical mission. If the next EPA administrator fails to learn from Pruitt’s example, we will continue defeating the agency’s actions in court. ”
