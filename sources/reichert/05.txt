“The addition of Japan to the Trans-Pacific Partnership will add an already considerable export destination for Washington goods and services to this comprehensive and high-standard agreement. Greater access to the Japanese market, through the removal of significant tariff and non-tariff barriers, could substantially benefit Washington growers, businesses, and workers. Therefore, we must continue to ensure that Japan is committed to the overall objectives of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and not slow down the negotiations. I welcome the agreement made that begins to address these serious, longstanding barriers to trade and will continue to engage with USTR on this critical opportunity for Washington exporters.”
