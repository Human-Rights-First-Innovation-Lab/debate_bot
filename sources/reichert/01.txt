"When President Lincoln issued his original Thanksgiving Proclamation in 1863, there was much to be ungrateful for.  Civil War was raging and many people were suffering severe hardship.  But even amidst all of that turmoil, the nation paused and remembered just how much there was to be thankful for.  Today, on this Thanksgiving, I urge you to do the same.  Our country stands 150 years after that proclamation as one of the most successful, most free nations this world has ever seen.  In each of our lives, we have been blessed in both large and small ways.  Remember those today and have a very happy Thanksgiving."
