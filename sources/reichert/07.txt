“The budget proposed by Chairman Ryan is the only plan on the table that takes a responsible approach to America’s fiscal problems.  The 2014 budget not only cuts wasteful spending that has caused the enormous growth in our national deficit, it lays out a clear plan to balance the budget in ten years.  Neither the Senate nor the President have proposed a balanced budget, and it remains highly unlikely that they will do so.
“The House budget also lays out the path for comprehensive tax reform.  This is a provision that I and my House Ways and Means Colleagues explicitly called for in a letter to Chairman Ryan earlier this month, and I am pleased to see that it is one of the cornerstones of this budget.  Comprehensive tax reform is something we owe the American people.  We must create a tax code that is flatter and fairer, reducing the tax burden on the American people and encouraging business growth and job creation.”
