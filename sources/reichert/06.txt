“As Washington’s second largest export market, Japan’s formal announcement is welcome news. It also highlights the importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This high standard, 21st century agreement holds significant promise for Washington businesses, farmers, workers, and services providers. However, in order for Washington businesses to truly benefit from such an agreement, it must be comprehensive in scope and ensure a level playing field for businesses competing in all sectors. Though progress has recently been made, there are longstanding challenges in the U.S. – Japan trade relationship that must be addressed. As consultations over Japan’s candidacy continue, I urge the U.S. and Japanese governments to work together to fully resolve these issues.”
