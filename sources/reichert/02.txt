"Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the members of AmeriCorps and their service to this country. On Saturday, September 21, 2013, AmeriCorps will celebrate their 20th anniversary. For 20 years, their first priority has been the communities of America. Their members have served in thousands of ways across the nation. In my own home state, members of the AmeriCorps Conservation Corps were critical in assisting the management of the Colockum Tarps Fire this past year--a fire which burned across over 20,000 acres. This is only one small example of their commitment to helping others in any way possible.
"Members like these set an example to all Americans. Their actions continually encourage people of all ages and from all walks of life to engage in community service projects and help others. I am encouraged by their dedication and witness daily the benefits of community engagement and service that they work so hard to promote. Once more, I thank and congratulate them on achieving this milestone."
