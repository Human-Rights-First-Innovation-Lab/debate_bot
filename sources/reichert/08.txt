A successful Secretary of the Interior must balance the need to protect and utilize our many natural resources with the promotion of job creation and economic growth.  The president’s nominee, Sally Jewell, has been a capable CEO for one of Washington State’s most successful companies, REI, and I hope that if confirmed she uses her extensive leadership experience to enhance effectiveness and improve balance at the Department of the Interior.  I will be paying close attention to the Senate confirmation hearings. It is only after we have better knowledge of her qualifications and her vision for this department that we can truly determine if she is the right person for this very important position.
