Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on National Teacher’s Appreciation Day, to recognize and honor the teachers of America.  Year in and year out, they dedicate their lives to educating our children and helping them to succeed both in and out of the classroom.  They not only teach us to read and write, but for many of us, it is a teacher who first shows us that we can achieve whatever we put our minds to; they tell us that anything is possible, that it is okay to dream.  The confidence and curiosity that teachers instill in their students are just as important as the traditional subjects they teach; it is these life lessons that will resonate with our children well into adulthood.
In my own experience, the teacher who brought these truths home to me was Mr. Gowenlock.  Mr. Gowenlock was my  high school geometry teacher as well as one of my football coaches.  He made sure I knew that I had the ability to be a great man, and the only thing that would get in the way was my own doubt.  He was one of the first to fully believe in me, and that is a gift that has made it possible for me to be where I am today.
I hope that students and parents everywhere will join with me in recognizing the importance and value of good teachers.  Without them, America would not be the beacon of hope that it is today.  We owe them our gratitude and our respect.  I have fought for teachers in the past, with legislation such as the Teacher Tax Relief Act, and I will continue to fight for them. Teachers must have the tools and support they need to ensure our children receive the best education possible for they will be the ones shaping the future of this great nation.  Thank you.
