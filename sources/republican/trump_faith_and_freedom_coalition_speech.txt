Thank you for having me at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority. This is my ninth time speaking at this event.
We have a big rally tonight in Philadelphia. Someone got confused and had me scheduled for both events, but I decided to do this one during the day and the rally later. I couldn’t cancel on Ralph Reed and the coalition. Thanks to Ralph Reed and executive director Tim Head for their leadership. Thanks also to Congressman Barry Loudermilk and former Congressman Lee Zeldin. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley are doing great work. My friend Amanda and Corey Lewandowski got me involved in this eight years ago. Dr. Alvina King, Steve Witkoff, and Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice are also here. Thanks for your support.
Special thanks to the grassroots movement of volunteers who power the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Your efforts are crucial during the election period. Election Day now stretches over two months. We must vote and ensure our votes count. We need to be vigilant against corruption and make sure everything is honest.
This year, you will knock on 10 million doors, reach 18 million Christian voters, and register one million new voters across 130,000 churches. Encourage voting among evangelicals and Christians, who often go to church but don’t vote as much as they should. Gun owners also need to vote to protect their rights. The NRA gave me a big endorsement, but statistically, gun owners don’t vote much.
We need to work together to defeat Joe Biden, defend our values, and make America better. This election is crucial for our country. In 2016, we had a bad border situation, but it’s much worse now. Joe Biden has weakened our borders and our economy, leading to high inflation and deficits. His administration has failed on many fronts, pushing radical agendas in schools and undermining the rule of law.
We must save America from these left-wing policies. November 5th will be a critical day for our country. We need Christian voters to turn out in large numbers to make a change. The radical left is trying to silence and demoralize Christians, keeping them out of politics. We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. Christianity and our future depend on this election.

The reason the left comes after religious believers is that they know our allegiance is to our country and Creator, not to them. We do not answer to bureaucrats in Washington, but to God. Today, if you say that, they want to arrest you. They think the 10 Commandments are a bad thing. Has anyone read this incredible stuff? They don’t want it to go up in schools.
It’s a crazy world. Who would think that open borders, where people flood in by the millions, including prisoners, mental patients, and terrorists, are good? Who would think that men playing in women’s sports is okay? In my first term, I defended Judeo-Christian heritage like no President before. With your help, I will continue to fight for our values and our civilization for four more years in the White House.
We’re going to fix this quickly. The hardest part is dealing with the nearly 20 million people who entered illegally. Many came from prisons and mental institutions. Whenever I imitate Joe Biden’s confusion, the media misrepresents it. With us, they try to make good things look bad. We have to work harder. I told my kids it would be easier if we were Democrats. We have to run the entire East Coast to win.
Think of what we’ve achieved. We stood up to defend religious liberty like no other President. I’ve faced many challenges, more than any President. I’ve taken a lot of hits, but I’m honored to keep going.
I could be home, avoiding court cases started by Joe Biden and his team. We restored rights for doctors, nurses, teachers, and faith groups. I stopped the IRS from using the Johnson Amendment to interfere with pastors’ freedom of speech. Joe Biden took it away, but I will restore it. I will give it back on the first day.
The Johnson Amendment took away your rights. Ministers, pastors, rabbis, and other religious leaders weren’t allowed to say political things without risking their tax exemptions. I changed that, and it will be changed again. We want to hear from our religious leaders.
I issued guidance that the right to freedom of worship does not end at the door to a public school. I was the first and only President to convene a meeting at the United Nations to end religious persecution worldwide. Other Presidents promised to do it but didn’t follow through. I did it, and nothing bad happened.

A friend of mine, Amanda, got me involved in this eight years ago. Corey Lewandowski and I decided to take action. Thank you, Corey.

Dr. Alvina King, a longtime friend, is here. The lights are blinding, so I can't see anyone in the room. Steve Witkoff, a great businessman, is also here. Thanks, Steve. Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, thank you for your endorsement and help. Moms for Liberty has been great.
Special thanks to the grassroots volunteers who power the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Your involvement is crucial during the extended election period. Election Day now stretches over two and a half months, starting in early September. We must vote and ensure our votes count. We need to be vigilant against corruption and ensure everything is honest.
You are the police of your vote. Ensure it counts. If I knew there would be no corruption, I’d stop campaigning right now. We have this thing won. You are indispensable. We’re not going to have a country left if we don’t act.

The left is trying to shame and silence Christians and keep them out of politics. They don't want you to vote. Christians cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. If Joe Biden gets back in, Christianity will not be safe. He is surrounded by people who are undermining the country.
The left comes after religious believers because they know our allegiance is to our country and Creator, not to them. We do not answer to bureaucrats in Washington. They think the 10 Commandments are bad. They don’t want them displayed in schools.
It’s a crazy world. Open borders allow millions of people, including prisoners and mental patients, to enter. Terrorists are entering in record numbers. Men playing in women’s sports is accepted. In my first term, I defended Judeo-Christian heritage like no President before. With your help, I will continue to fight for our values for four more years.
We’re going to fix this quickly. Nearly 20 million people who entered illegally will have to leave. Many came from prisons and mental institutions. The media misrepresents my actions and tries to make good things look bad. We have to work harder than the other side.
We have support from autoworkers, teamsters, and cementers. We stood up to communists, Marxists, and fascists to defend religious liberty. I’ve faced many challenges. Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln faced tough times, but now they say I’ve been treated the worst.
I could be home, avoiding court cases started by Joe Biden and his team. We restored rights for doctors, nurses, teachers, and faith groups. We defended the Little Sisters of the Poor. I stopped the IRS from using the Johnson Amendment to interfere with pastors' freedom of speech. Joe Biden took it away, but I will restore it.

I did it, and nothing bad happened.



In Nevada, where we’re leading by 14 points, a waitress mentioned the difficulties with government taxation on tips. I proposed no tax on tips. It’s a great idea to support hardworking individuals like her. Joe Biden and his administration are desperate to stop us because we are the only ones who can stop them. They are weaponizing law enforcement against their opponents and turning America into a place like Cuba or Venezuela. They are trying to silence dissent and put political adversaries behind bars.
Al Capone, despite his notorious reputation, was indicted less often than I have been. My parents would be shocked to see this, as it’s all about election interference. All these indictments are politically motivated by Biden's administration. The Supreme Court recently made significant decisions that show their courage and insight. They have made great decisions on regulations that will free up businesses.
I am leading in every poll, not just against Joe Biden but also against Kamala Harris and others. Democrats are trying to overturn the results of state primaries at the behest of their donors. We have taken in record numbers of donations, mostly from small donors. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy, and the radical-left Democrats want to destroy it. They rigged the 2020 election, and we won’t let them do it again in 2024.
Every time I am indicted, I consider it a badge of honor because I am being indicted for you. Our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. In the end, they’re after you, and I will always stand in their way. We’re not going to let what happened to many countries happen to ours.
We are joined tonight by many fantastic Florida patriots, including Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Rick Scott, and many congressmen and state representatives. They have all been doing a great job and are here to support our cause.
My sons are here tonight. Donald Trump, Jr. is an incredible guy, very tough and strong, a great speaker with great talent. Eric Trump is also here. He has done an incredible job at the company and has handled numerous subpoenas. Thank you, Eric, for your great work.
My youngest son, Barron Trump, who just turned 18, is going to college. He got into every college he wanted and made his choice. This is the first time he’s ever done this. Welcome to the scene, Barron. You’re pretty popular, and it’s good to have you here.
I also have talented grandchildren. Two of them are great golfers. Kai and Chloe, who hits a long ball for her size. Vanessa Trump and Don Jr. are here too. Vanessa, please stand up. Thank you, Don Jr. Don the third is also here. A real friend of the family, Kimberly Guilfoyle, started on The Five and was a big star on television. She has always been good to me. Thank you, Kimberly, for being here.
I know I didn’t introduce many congressmen and others, but we need to get back to the business at hand. Is it too hot for anyone? No? Once you get used to the fact that you’re soaking wet, it’s not so bad.

From the moment we take back the White House, I believe we will have four of the greatest years in our country’s history. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, we will settle the war between Russia and Ukraine and prevent the world from entering World War III. We’re very close to World War III, and Biden doesn’t have a clue. The attack on Israel and inflation would’ve never happened if the election wasn’t rigged. We must get out and vote to prevent this from happening again.
If I were president, the embarrassing withdrawal from Afghanistan wouldn’t have happened. The situation in Ukraine wouldn’t have escalated. I had a good relationship with Putin and prevented conflicts. The attack on Israel wouldn’t have occurred because Iran was broke under my sanctions, and they had no funds for terrorism.
During my presidency, we had no terror attacks and very few terrorists entered the country. In 2019, zero terrorists entered. Now, thousands of terrorists are pouring in. We would not have Russian warships and nuclear submarines surrounding Cuba. The media doesn’t talk about it, but it’s a significant threat.
I canceled Obama’s deal with the Cuban dictatorship and reimposed sanctions. Biden has gone soft on Cuban communists. As president, I will stand with the Cuban people in their quest for justice and freedom.
In my next term, we will build a state-of-the-art missile defense shield, made entirely in the USA, right here in Florida. I will not cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age. Biden’s policies are unsustainable, and we must protect these programs.
We will rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty. We will clean up and renovate Washington, D.C., making it a beautiful and safe capital. We will do the same with other cities, working with Democrat governors and mayors if necessary.
On day one, I will sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing inappropriate content onto children. I will not support schools with vaccine or mask mandates, and I will keep men out of women’s sports.
I will fully uphold the Second Amendment, protect innocent life, restore free speech, and secure our elections. We aim for one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, and voter ID. Until then, Republicans must vote in large numbers to ensure our victory.
We have many dedicated supporters here tonight, including several Florida patriots and congressmen. They are all doing a great job and supporting our cause.
The Biden administration has done more damage to our country than any previous administration. We must save America by voting early, voting absentee, and ensuring our votes are counted. To help ensure election integrity, sign up at ProtectTheVote.com.
From Jacksonville to Miami, from Tampa to Tallahassee, and from Destin to Doral, we inherit the legacy of American patriots who built this nation. Together, we will make America the greatest nation in the world.


Our nation is in decline. We have the highest inflation in 50 years, banks are collapsing, and interest rates are rising. Energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history, and we are no longer energy independent. We are begging other countries for oil, despite having abundant resources. Saudi Arabia and Russia are reducing oil production and increasing prices while we halt drilling in Alaska and other areas. Our leaders are pushing the Green New Deal, which is unrealistic and harmful. They demand electric cars, which are costly and rely on materials from China, while we have ample gasoline. There is even a push to make military tanks electric.
It's great to be back in Nevada. We’re going to win Nevada and defeat Senator Jacky Rosen. For three and a half years, Nevada has seen Joe Biden’s poor handling of the southern border. We’re leading by 12 points here. Last week, Biden signed an executive order that is weak on border security and promotes human trafficking. We built 571 miles of border wall and had strong policies. Biden’s administration has allowed millions to enter illegally. We need to reinstate our policies to secure the border.
Biden should take a cognitive and drug test before the debate. Under my administration, we caught illegal border crossers and had the most secure border in history. The Afghan situation was a national embarrassment. Biden’s policies have been disastrous, especially for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. We will end the tax on tips for workers in restaurants. We’ll also end the mandate on electric cars and trucks and provide gasoline and diesel options.
We need strong borders, low taxes, and a strong military. We must ensure fair elections and stop election fraud. Democrats can only win by cheating. We need a strong military, low taxes, great education, and no regulation. We must watch for voter fraud and ensure fair elections. Our goal is to make America great again.
The world respected our country under my administration. We need to avoid World War III by re-electing me. Thank you all, and get out and vote. If we win Nevada, we win the whole thing. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix. I’m thrilled to be back in Arizona with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. Special thanks to Charlie Kirk and Turning Point Action for making this event possible. Thanks to members of Congress, including Eli Crane, Andy Biggs, Debbie Lesko, and Paul Gosar.
We need honest elections. If we had them, I’d have stopped campaigning two weeks ago. We must be too big to rig. Congressional candidate Abe Hamadeh and Senate candidate Kari Lake will do fantastic jobs. We remember and thank the heroes of D-Day who landed at Normandy 80 years ago. We have a job to make America great again. We’re beating Biden by a lot, and we’ve raised almost $400 million in campaign funds. We must change the system and fix the courts.
We’re going to win Arizona and tell Joe Biden he’s fired. Biden’s executive orders allow millions of illegal immigrants into our country. We need to reinstate border policies immediately. Biden should take a cognitive and drug test before the debate. Our policies brought illegal immigration to the lowest level. Biden’s policies have created the worst border nightmare in history. Without borders, we don’t have a country.
On day one, I will rescind Biden’s executive order and terminate his open border policies. The result of Biden’s actions will be more Americans killed by illegal alien criminals and more children trafficked and sold into slavery. Biden’s administration is responsible for more women and children being sold into slavery than anyone else in modern history. We will use Title 42 to end child trafficking and return trafficked children to their families. We will save countless women and children from slavery.
The Biden border invasion is an all-out war on working-class minorities and economic warfare on African American and Hispanic American families. It’s also hurting unions. Illegal immigration causes rent and housing costs to skyrocket. In everything he does, Joe Biden puts illegal aliens first, betraying American citizens. He’s the worst president in history.
As your president, I will put Americans first. We will shift federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement and deploy the US Navy to oppose the cartels. We will stop the invasion and begin the largest domestic deportation operation. We will secure our borders and protect our country.
We need a victory that’s too big to rig. Everyone must get out and vote, starting with early voting in mid-September. We will make America great again.
